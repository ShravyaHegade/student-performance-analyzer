#  Student Performance Analyzer (NumPy Only)

##  Project Overview
The Student Performance Analyzer is a data analysis project built using
Python and NumPy. The project analyzes student academic performance based
on GPA, study hours, attendance, part-time jobs, academic major, and
extracurricular activities.

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights using pure
NumPy operations without using Pandas or machine learning libraries.

## Analysis Performed
- Statistical analysis of GPA (average, highest, lowest)
- Identification of top-performing and weak-performing students
- Correlation analysis between:
  - Study Hours and GPA
  - Attendance and GPA
- Impact of part-time jobs on GPA
- Major-wise GPA analysis
- Extracurricular activities impact on GPA
- Attendance-based academic risk identification

##  Key Insights
- Average GPA of students is 2.99
- Study hours and attendance show weak but positive relationships with GPA
- Students with part-time jobs show slightly better average GPA
- Academic performance varies across different majors
- Participation in extracurricular activities does not negatively impact GPA

##  Conclusion
The project demonstrates that student performance is influenced by multiple
factors. Balanced study habits, time management, and participation in
activities contribute positively to academic success.
